											<h2>N Days of Solitude</h2>
											<p>April, 2020</p>
											<p>I’ve been working from home because of the coronavirus in Vancouver. I’ve been more productive than I’d expected, but nothing ensures productivity in a CS student like a prospective FANG offer.</p>
											<p>H-mart was the most chaotic I’ve ever seen it when I went this afternoon to pick up a pre-made soup packs for dinner. The guys who work the store were wearing these really intense masks and directing customers to different cash registers. The line snaked around a precarious display of Japanese soft candies and encircled the ready to go Korean food stand. The manager had to keep telling customers who approached the cash registers from the far side of the prepared foods stand that there was a line on the other side. I think that in another life, I’d design grocery store layouts for a living.</p>
											<p>I started buying shelf-stable food a few weeks ago. The only thing I stocked up that I wouldn’t normally buy anyway was Starbucks blond roast instant coffee, because I’ll lose my mind without roasted coffee, which I buy every day. I went for a walk today to hit my 10,000 steps and couldn’t shake the feeling that everything was filthy—the car carcass, the standing puddles of morning’s rain. Instead of going to the soccer field next to my apartment, I stayed on city roads, spying budding trees and crocuses. It’s comforting to think that nature is indifferent to our struggles.</p>
										<p>But things are mostly normal still. The bubble tea place is busy as ever: “Business is boomin',” the guy behind the counter said. There are still kids at the beach, men still holler from their cars. And the skyline still glimmers in the night.</p>
									<h2>2020</h2>
									<p>January, 2020</p>	
									<p>It feels futile now to do the formulaic self-reflections and resolutions I always do at the start of the year. Because I’m all right, and I always will be, as long as the earth continues to feed me and the country keeps me free. I’m 21 and I get paid to code products and that’s all I ever could have asked.
									</p>
									<p>I used to worry about finding a job, or going to grad school, or having to leave Vancouver. But now it’s not myself or my ability to survive a given situation that worries me. Now my mind flits to the cat I’ve always wanted. Now I feel my attention flickering, my mind too quick to anger at some bullshit Instagram drama that is so beside the point.
										And my wants keep multiplying at a pace I can’t abide. What right have I to desire a pair of Louboutin with sparkles around the toe; a top breed kitten; a Dior canvas bag and a McQueen butterfly shawl I’ll figure out later their utility; one more Gucci? dark mode for this site? This is starting to feel like an American Psycho movie. I try to lose my mind in books and projects to keep myself from thinking it. But always the words return: The end of all wanting is all I’ve been wanting.</p>
									<p>And that’s just the way that I feel.</p>
									<h2 id="Newyork">New York</h2>
						<p>August, 2019</p>
						<p>I first saw New York when I was twenty, and it was end of summertime. I got off a WestJet at LaGuardia terminal in a dress and cardigan which had seemed very smart in Vancouver but seemed less smart already, even in the LaGuardia terminal, and the warm air smelled of mildew and some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever listened about New York. </p>
						<p>That first night I opened my window on the bus into town and watched for the skyline, but all I could see were the wastes of Queens and big signs that said MIDTOWN TUNNEL THIS LANE and then a flood of summer rain (even that seemed remarkable and exotic, for I had come out of the West where there was no summer rain), and for the next three days I sat wrapped in thick cardigan and tried to get over a cold and a high fever. 
						</p>
						<p>It is less often said that New York is also, at least for those of us who came there from somewhere else, a city only for the very young.
						</p>
						<p>We stopped at Lady M and bought a slices of cakes and stood on the corner eating it and knew that I had come out out of the West and reached the mirage. I could taste the cream and feel the soft air blowing from a subway grating on my legs and I could smell lilac and garbage and expensive perfume and I knew that it would cost something sooner or later—because I did not belong there, did not come from there—but when you are twenty-two or twenty-three, you figure that later you will have a high emotional balance, and be able to pay whatever it costs. </p>
						<p>Nothing was irrevocable; everything was within reach. Just around every corner lay something curious and interesting, something I had never before seen or done or known about. </p>
						<h2 id="Japan">Zen and Spirtuality of Shōnan</h2>
						<p>July, 2018</p>
						<p>The day before our planned departure to Kyoto, western Japan braced itself for torrential rains, rising rivers, severe rain and flooding. We watched the news with wary eyes and scrambled to find an alternative route and homestay. My friend suggested Fujisawa, a small seaside town south of Tokyo. Considering my next-to-none understanding of Japanese geography and the fact I was unable to communicate with almost anyone except for my companion, I didn’t know what to expect.</p>
					<p>We took the train from Tokyo and within two hours, we were greeted by a giant Kannon statue on the hill from the station. The town was a polarizing departure from commercialized Tokyo, where an absence of intense visual onslaught and inner-city sounds awaited us.</p>	
				<p>The Shonan Monorail hangs suspended from the overhead rail as it makes its way toward the coast. The carriage cuts through city so closely below that you might expect it to brush the top of homes along the way.</p>	
			<p>We got off at Enoshima station and the city unraveled itself under the bleaching sun. I was surprised by the sheer volume of tourists crowding the station; the locals from Tokyo often head down to the beaches here for the weekend. We followed the flow of people and soon enough arrived at a long bridge that links Sagami Bay to Enoshima along the Shonan coast. The salty breeze off the coast made the oppressive summer heat a bit more bearable.</p>	
		<p>Enoshima Shrine, dedicated to the sea deity Benzaiten, was located at the end of the bridge. We arrived at its Torii gate, which marks the separation between the world of humans and that of the gods. Inside the gate, there was a bell in front of the haiden. I took hold of the rope with both hands and give it a firm shake, then prayed for peace of mind.</p>	
	<p>I need to clarify that I am not a religious person, but the previous semester was hard on me. I dreaded waking up to find email after email of incessant projects. I felt frivolous and sometimes like Sisyphus. I read Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance over the summer and had copied chunks of it into my journal. I tried to cultivate the peace of mind Pirsig had written about, which means “we do not separate ourselves from our surroundings,” while I aimlessly wandered the streets of Enoshima in search of some sort of spiritual enlightenment.</p>	
	<p>The reverence for Japanese tradition is apparent in Fujisawa too, with not only the temples and shrines that are dotted throughout neighbourhood, but also celebration of summer festival. On our train ride back, my friend pointed to a group of men in yukata beating the drums and told me to take a look.</p>
<p>Summer festival reverberated through the streets. The locals all got together and carried their local shrine’s mikoshi, portable shrine, around the neighbourhood to an area designated by the festival. It is symbolic of carrying the deity of the shrine to the festival.The sounds of the streets increased in volume as the night progressed, and I felt my voice blending in with the crowd. Somehow, beyond the lines of people shuffling toward the shrine to say their prayers, beyond the repeating drum beats and men wobbling their mikoshi down the street, beyond all the strange iconography of this religion that’s so foreign to me, I was no longer trapped in the isolation of my head and felt complete and at peace with myself and the world.</p>	
<p>And where do I begin? I am a person who has been afflicted with perpetual anxiety, whose best moments are tarnished by the knowledge that they are transient, whose worries mean nothing and everything. But it was moment of forgetting that, forgetting cynicism, dread and tomorrow down the road. I reminisced about staring into a lush suburb from the monorail, or dipping in the water beneath the blue, blue, electric blue of Fujisawa sky, or watching the local men in yukata chanting through the street. I thought about these moments, moments of grace. Moments when the wall of you and your surrounding comes down and you feel nothing other than completely presence and peacefulness within you.</p>
<h2>Pining For Home</h2>
									<p>May, 2017</p>
									<p>It’s almost September, and never has a year flown by so quickly. It’s my first year away from my mom, away from sauntering down Yonge street with my friends and an ice-coffee in hand, and sleepless nights in an AC-less room. I was frankly miserable in my first year, constantly pining for home.</p>	
								<p>Around this time last year, I was writing my first essay in collage, trying to assemble fragments of ambition, anxiety and loneliness into a narrative. I settled on the love story for my city, Toronto, Ontario, and tried to embed a feel-good message of growth and hope. I spoke of the people that made Toronto feel like home with the unabashed optimism. For months, I felt good about my essay because I’d meticulously arranged it to feel true. </p>	
							<p>I flew back to Toronto, back in December. My family friend deposits me right in front of her apartment, a brown, brick-and-concrete block of 70s brutalism, like the thousands of others that cluster around the city’s Northern and Eastern quadrants. Toronto is all lines, all quadrants, all blocks of wide pavements and a rotation of four streets meeting adjacent to one another, again and again. But unlike New York, Toronto was never meant to be a grid – instead, streets were renamed and collated with that aspiration, and although this is barely visible save for under the overhead of Google Maps, there’s a Beta-ness to the intersections that would make you nod at this surreal fact.</p>	
						<p>I read it somewhere -- probably in Joan Didion article -- life cycle occurs faster in the east: plants, for instance, grow fast and ruthless, and, before you know it, have launched an assault on even the newest, most pristine buildings. The pavements are discolored within a year of being set; fences collect red-brown rust; roads crack far more readily – although it could have just been the bureaucracy, the dramatic irony of a state barely holding itself together, completing the metaphor. But at 5 PM in December, Toronto rusts far more miserably, identical grey condos growing grimier and grimmer and further apart from the image enlisted in the Tridel prospectus, just as fresh cut grass molds into grey slush.
							In April, I returned to my parents’ home in Beijing. They had renovated parts of the house, though calling it renovation would have been a stretch. It was a mere replacement old furniture and tiles with bright and fresh plastics on the same landing. I observed my mother tiptoe around the kitchen in the morning preparing breakfast for the family. I overheard my father put on the kind of Chinese reality show he swore he could never like when he thought I was asleep. And I felt like an intruder in this place.</p>	
						<p>See, I’d invented the story I wanted to believe – the one where any place can become home out of sheer good-will, hard work and human kindness – and made myself believe it. A year later I don’t need to impress anyone anymore, and the essay feels stale.</p>
