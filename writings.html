<h2>Nothing but an idle dream</h2>
<p>June, 2021</p>
<p>I see it when I open my eyes</p>
<p>Annotated code like an anxious zygote</p>
<p>With marshalled forces to optimize</p>
<p>efficiency, parallelism, the progress trap</p>
<p>I see it when I close my eyes</p>
<p>Monster underneath my bed</p>
<p>Hands Around my neck</p>
<p>All this time he is mumbling truth </p>
<p>Truth of tomorrow </p>
<p>And tomorrows down the road</p>
<p>As I kick and wail in silence </p>
<p>My therapist told me I could deconstruct</p>
<p>The mental architecture of the race tracks</p>
<p>Then endless cycle of self flagellation</p>
<p>She said peace is possible </p>
<p>If I could rewrite the blueprints</p>
<p>So I found utopia on a Sunday afternoon</p>
<p>time traveling and space warping with Plath</p>
<p>Fractured mosaic of visions of a new life, a new world </p>
<p>There and then I was no body’s daughter </p>
<p>drifting with the changing of winds </p>
<p>weaving dreams with Zeniba at swamp bottom </p>
<p>But the aching returns on Monday morning </p>
<p>It returns from friends and friends of friends </p>
<p>It returns from a clairvoyant certainty of entertaining Yubaba </p>
<p>From the moment i enter crying </p>
<p>To the moment i leave dying </p>
<p>The tendril of smoke follows </p>
<h2>Mid-spring's day</h2>
<p>April, 2021</p>
<p>Yesterday, returning from Ajisai grab-and-go with sashimi box I been getting for lunch,  I walked pass the blossoming cherry blossom canopy on 45th, all buds busting open, gushing pedals into the street. I removed my feet from my sneaker and extended my toes wide on the pavement to show that I welcomed the oasis. Several of women stopped by and took out their phone for pictures. I was thinking how no obstacle can strip us of the simple pleasures of a mid-spring's day</p>
<h2>N Days of Solitude</h2>
<p>April, 2020</p>
<p>I’ve been working from home because of the coronavirus in Vancouver. I’ve been more productive than I’d expected, but nothing ensures productivity in a CS student like a prospective FANG offer.</p>
<p>H-mart was the most chaotic I’ve ever seen it when I went this afternoon to pick up a pre-made soup packs for dinner. The guys who work the store were wearing these really intense masks and directing customers to different cash registers. The line snaked around a precarious display of Japanese soft candies and encircled the ready to go Korean food stand. The manager had to keep telling customers who approached the cash registers from the far side of the prepared foods stand that there was a line on the other side. I think that in another life, I’d design grocery store layouts for a living.</p>
<p>I started buying shelf-stable food a few weeks ago. The only thing I stocked up that I wouldn’t normally buy anyway was Starbucks blond roast instant coffee, because I’ll lose my mind without roasted coffee, which I buy every day. I went for a walk today to hit my 10,000 steps and couldn’t shake the feeling that everything was filthy—the car carcass, the standing puddles of morning’s rain. Instead of going to the soccer field next to my apartment, I stayed on city roads, spying budding trees and crocuses. It’s comforting to think that nature is indifferent to our struggles.</p>
<p>But things are mostly normal still. The bubble tea place is busy as ever: “Business is boomin',” the guy behind the counter said. There are still kids at the beach, men still holler from their cars. And the skyline still glimmers in the night.</p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p>January, 2020</p>	
<p>It feels futile now to do the formulaic self-reflections and resolutions I always do at the start of the year. Because I’m all right, and I always will be, as long as the earth continues to feed me and the country keeps me free. I’m 21 and I get paid to code products and that’s all I ever could have asked.
</p>
<p>I used to worry about finding a job, or going to grad school, or having to leave Vancouver. But now it’s not myself or my ability to survive a given situation that worries me. Now my mind flits to the cat I’ve always wanted. Now I feel my attention flickering, my mind too quick to anger at some bullshit Instagram drama that is so beside the point.
And my wants keep multiplying at a pace I can’t abide. What right have I to desire a pair of Louboutin with sparkles around the toe; a top breed kitten; a Dior canvas bag and a McQueen butterfly shawl I’ll figure out later their utility; one more Gucci? dark mode for this site? This is starting to feel like an American Psycho movie. I try to lose my mind in books and projects to keep myself from thinking it. But always the words return: The end of all wanting is all I’ve been wanting.</p>
<p>And that’s just the way that I feel.</p>
<h2>21岁的矫情诗</h2>
<p>白天能不能不靠咖啡因解困？</p>
<p>晚上能不能不靠褪黑素入眠？</p>
<p>最长和常的通话是amex和td。</p>
<p>流眼泪不值钱，错误却会丢钱。</p>
<p>少盐少油的饭，还是自己做吧。</p>
<h2 id="Newyork">New York</h2>
<p>August, 2019</p>
<p>I first saw New York when I was twenty, and it was end of summertime. I got off a WestJet at LaGuardia terminal in a dress and cardigan which had seemed very smart in Vancouver but seemed less smart already, even in the LaGuardia terminal, and the warm air smelled of mildew and some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever listened about New York. </p>
<p>That first night I opened my window on the bus into town and watched for the skyline, but all I could see were the wastes of Queens and big signs that said MIDTOWN TUNNEL THIS LANE and then a flood of summer rain (even that seemed remarkable and exotic, for I had come out of the West where there was no summer rain), and for the next three days I sat wrapped in thick cardigan and tried to get over a cold and a high fever. 
</p>
<p>It is less often said that New York is also, at least for those of us who came there from somewhere else, a city only for the very young.
</p>
<p>We stopped at Lady M and bought a slices of cakes and stood on the corner eating it and knew that I had come out out of the West and reached the mirage. I could taste the cream and feel the soft air blowing from a subway grating on my legs and I could smell lilac and garbage and expensive perfume and I knew that it would cost something sooner or later—because I did not belong there, did not come from there—but when you are twenty-one or something, you figure that later you will have a high emotional balance, and be able to pay whatever it costs. </p>
<p>Nothing was irrevocable; everything was within reach. Just around every corner lay something curious and interesting, something I had never before seen or done or known about. </p>
<h2 id="Japan">Zen and Spirtuality of Shōnan</h2>
<p>July, 2018</p>
<p>The day before our planned departure to Kyoto, western Japan braced itself for torrential rains, rising rivers, severe rain and flooding. We watched the news with wary eyes and scrambled to find an alternative route and homestay. My friend suggested Fujisawa, a small seaside town south of Tokyo. Considering my next-to-none understanding of Japanese geography and the fact I was unable to communicate with almost anyone except for my companion, I didn’t know what to expect.</p>
<p>We took the train from Tokyo and within two hours, we were greeted by a giant Kannon statue on the hill from the station. The town was a polarizing departure from commercialized Tokyo, where an absence of intense visual onslaught and inner-city sounds awaited us.</p>	
<p>The Shonan Monorail hangs suspended from the overhead rail as it makes its way toward the coast. The carriage cuts through city so closely below that you might expect it to brush the top of homes along the way.</p>	
<p>We got off at Enoshima station and the city unraveled itself under the bleaching sun. I was surprised by the sheer volume of tourists crowding the station; the locals from Tokyo often head down to the beaches here for the weekend. We followed the flow of people and soon enough arrived at a long bridge that links Sagami Bay to Enoshima along the Shonan coast. The salty breeze off the coast made the oppressive summer heat a bit more bearable.</p>	
<p>Enoshima Shrine, dedicated to the sea deity Benzaiten, was located at the end of the bridge. We arrived at its Torii gate, which marks the separation between the world of humans and that of the gods. Inside the gate, there was a bell in front of the haiden. I took hold of the rope with both hands and give it a firm shake, then prayed for peace of mind.</p>	
<p>I need to clarify that I am not a religious person, but the previous semester was hard on me. I dreaded waking up to find email after email of incessant projects. I felt frivolous and sometimes like Sisyphus. I read Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance over the summer and had copied chunks of it into my journal. I tried to cultivate the peace of mind Pirsig had written about, which means “we do not separate ourselves from our surroundings,” while I aimlessly wandered the streets of Enoshima in search of some sort of spiritual enlightenment.</p>	
<p>The reverence for Japanese tradition is apparent in Fujisawa too, with not only the temples and shrines that are dotted throughout neighbourhood, but also celebration of summer festival. On our train ride back, my friend pointed to a group of men in yukata beating the drums and told me to take a look.</p>
<p>Summer festival reverberated through the streets. The locals all got together and carried their local shrine’s mikoshi, portable shrine, around the neighbourhood to an area designated by the festival. It is symbolic of carrying the deity of the shrine to the festival.The sounds of the streets increased in volume as the night progressed, and I felt my voice blending in with the crowd. Somehow, beyond the lines of people shuffling toward the shrine to say their prayers, beyond the repeating drum beats and men wobbling their mikoshi down the street, beyond all the strange iconography of this religion that’s so foreign to me, I was no longer trapped in the isolation of my head and felt complete and at peace with myself and the world.</p>	
<p>And where do I begin? I am a person who has been afflicted with perpetual anxiety, whose best moments are tarnished by the knowledge that they are transient, whose worries mean nothing and everything. But it was moment of forgetting that, forgetting cynicism, dread and tomorrow down the road. I reminisced about staring into a lush suburb from the monorail, or dipping in the water beneath the blue, blue, electric blue of Fujisawa sky, or watching the local men in yukata chanting through the street. I thought about these moments, moments of grace. Moments when the wall of you and your surrounding comes down and you feel nothing other than completely presence and peacefulness within you.</p>
<h2>Linguistic Experience</h2>
<p>October, 2017</p>
<p>When I immigrated to Canada from China, English flew around me like a river. I began learning by mimicking the language of my classmates and picking out the words and phrases that seem to matter most: “washroom,” “girl’s,” “pepperoni.” </p>
<p>I learned to master two languages: English spoken to the public, and Mandarin spoken to myself. I learned to master the public language: assess the situations, construct sentences with the right words and the correct syntax, and learn from my mistakes. 
Fluency in my public language was achieved with enough practice. Nonetheless, as a visible minority, I felt pressured to assimilate; I had a violent desire to erase a life in my native tongue for the dominant language of Canada. I refused to speak to my parents in Mandarin and English soon became my household language. 
Over the years, my brain has banished Chinese and English also became my private language. I dream in English. I talk to myself in English. And my memories -- not only those about Canada but also those about China -- are cataloged in English. Nabokov once said in an interview, “My private tragedy, which cannot, indeed should not, be anybody’s concern, is that I had to abandon my natural language, my natural idiom.”I often feel a tinge of guilt when I hear my parents conversing in Mandarin when they think I am asleep. 
There was a time when I could write well in Mandarin, when my writing was used as models in my Chinese elementary school. Although I am still capable of speaking Mandarin in fragments and comprehending it verbally, I had lost the comforting intimacy between me and my mother tongue.  </p>


<h2>Pining For Home</h2>
<p>May, 2017</p>
<p>It’s almost September, and never has a year flown by so quickly. It’s my first year away from my mom, away from sauntering down Yonge street with my friends and an ice-coffee in hand, and sleepless nights in an AC-less room. I was frankly miserable in my first year, constantly pining for home.</p>	
<p>Around this time last year, I was writing my first essay in collage, trying to assemble fragments of ambition, anxiety and loneliness into a narrative. I settled on the love story for my city, Toronto, Ontario, and tried to embed a feel-good message of growth and hope. I spoke of the people that made Toronto feel like home with the unabashed optimism. For months, I felt good about my essay because I’d meticulously arranged it to feel true. </p>	
<p>I flew back to Toronto, back in December. My family friend deposits me right in front of her apartment, a brown, brick-and-concrete block of 70s brutalism, like the thousands of others that cluster around the city’s Northern and Eastern quadrants. Toronto is all lines, all quadrants, all blocks of wide pavements and a rotation of four streets meeting adjacent to one another, again and again. But unlike New York, Toronto was never meant to be a grid – instead, streets were renamed and collated with that aspiration, and although this is barely visible save for under the overhead of Google Maps, there’s a Beta-ness to the intersections that would make you nod at this surreal fact.</p>	
<p>I read it somewhere -- probably in Joan Didion article -- life cycle occurs faster in the east: plants, for instance, grow fast and ruthless, and, before you know it, have launched an assault on even the newest, most pristine buildings. The pavements are discolored within a year of being set; fences collect red-brown rust; roads crack far more readily – although it could have just been the bureaucracy, the dramatic irony of a state barely holding itself together, completing the metaphor. But at 5 PM in December, Toronto rusts far more miserably, identical grey condos growing grimier and grimmer and further apart from the image enlisted in the Tridel prospectus, just as fresh cut grass molds into grey slush.
In April, I returned to my parents’ home in Beijing. They had renovated parts of the house, though calling it renovation would have been a stretch. It was a mere replacement old furniture and tiles with bright and fresh plastics on the same landing. I observed my mother tiptoe around the kitchen in the morning preparing breakfast for the family. I overheard my father put on the kind of Chinese reality show he swore he could never like when he thought I was asleep. And I felt like an intruder in this place.</p>	
<p>See, I’d invented the story I wanted to believe – the one where any place can become home out of sheer good-will, hard work and human kindness – and made myself believe it. A year later I don’t need to impress anyone anymore, and the essay feels stale.</p>
<h2>With Love and Squalor</h2>
<p>October, 2016</p>
<p>When I boarded the afternoon flight for Vancouver, my total outfit consisted of a small carry-on baggage, a North Face rain jacket, and a black leather snap purse containing my ticket, passport, wallet, and a folded paper with my residential address on the West Mall.</p>
<p>It was early September. 
I was at the ripe age of seventeen, bright, timid, and full of the foolish illusions of youth. A gush of tears at my mother’s farewell wave, a touch in the throat when the plane engine clacked, a pathetic sigh as the familiar cosmopolitan environs passed in view. The threads which bound me so tightly to home were irreversibly broken. 
While stranded mid-air, I reached to the stale tourist catalogue packed in the back seat pocket. The cover page was a glossy picture ofSt. Michael's Cathedral. And I recall a very strange, inexplicableincident.
I had been volunteering as a tourist guide at St. Michael's Cathedral all day long and I was tired. Towards sunset, just before it got dark, I left my shift and sat on the steps of Banh Mi Boys Sandwich Shopunwrapping a sandwich.
The April sun bathed the clear frosty weather. All the skyscrapers sparkled and glittered in the brilliant light, a stark contrast from the gloomy hue emitted by the panhandler next to me on the steps.
The young man fidgeted and jittered in the chill, with his dwarfish figure, his bent back, his face with the stamp of forty years upon it, his jacket torn at the seams, his head, balding but for locks of wilted gingerish-grey hair. He was visibly emaciated; he seemed scarcely to have any body, it was as though there were nothing but clothes over his bones. 
I felt an unpleasant sensation clutch at my heart and offered him half of my sandwich. He took it gratefully,turned to me ,and pointed to a building on the other side of Queen Street—a structure that was, incidentally, the location of my volunteer work.</p>
<p>“What’s that building?” he asked.</p>
<p>“St. Michael's Cathedral,” I said. “It used to be all boys high school.”</p>
<p>“What’s the style?”</p>
<p>“Gothic Revival.”</p>
<p>“You think there could be some cuckoo up there in the attic, feeding off pigeon shit or something?” </p>
<p>I said probably.</p>
<p>“I sleep on a heat vent down on Dundas Square now. Jesus, the shelter is crap, but there is less cuckoo ticketing you. I get seven hours of sleep on good days.” </p>
<p>“Toronto certainly needs to improve its shelter for homelessness,” I consoled.</p>
<p>“Man, wouldn’t trade anything for this shit.” He pulled a lighter out of his pocket and a cigarette appeared in between his dirty calloused fingers.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess it’s inevitable to fall in love with this city,” I said, “even if it’s unreturned affection.”</p>
<p>The ray of sunshine had died away; the chill grew sharper with the deepening twilight; lights flared from the shops. I watched the road become congested with traffic. The unmistakable scent of exhaust fumes, greasy street food, and cigarette butts condensed. The street grew more crowded, and pedestrians threw disapproving glances at this unorthodox coalition: a girl and a homeless man; the disheveled tenants of the city.
With stifled indignation I turned my eyes away from the road, and took refuge behind half of my sandwich. Within a few minutes, I’d finished it.With an impatient gesture I flung myself from the steps and walked downed the road. The traffic began to move; the cars clanked past me. </p>
<p>I often leaf back and back to this moment: it seems incumbent to me now that I should have defended this timid intimate moment that I was sharing with the man from the pedestrians. Our shared unrequited love for the city. We have fallen in love with the city, naively, invincibly. We love the hot steam rising from the heat vent; the strands of sunlight bouncing off the buildings. And of course, we know this affection will never be reciprocated; we know how insignificant and miniscule our love is for a shelter, a city, an object so grand.
But maybe, we don’t want to it to know who we are or the extent of our passion for it. We are too sensitive, too self-conscious to be known. There is a certain comfort and freedom in unanswered affection; we can be who we are without morphing into the expectations of our lover. We can concoct a fairy tale in our minds about how every facet of us will be embraced by our lover. The ephemeral tendrils of cigarette smoke from the cigarette dangling between his parted lips; a girl whose hair was blown into disarray by the wind. 
Our love for the city offers separation and anonymity, the privilege to remain anonymous, pleasantly aloof, and comfortably foreign. We are free of the emotional baggage, real or imaginary. We love Toronto, and it will never remember, or even know who we are.Strangers to it. Its anonymous admirers. </p>
<p>I looked at the page bearing the residential address and wondered. I gazed at the mountain peaks emerging from the shedding clouds, the cobalt vastness of Pacific Ocean, the greenery passing in swift review: a vague conjecture of what Vancouver might be. The plane touched down. A girl has left her home, and left a piece of her heart in the city.  </p>

<h2>Weather Talk</h2>
<p>October, 2016</p>
<p>Don’t talk to me about the the foggy sky and incessant rain,</p>
<p>trivial, banal, utterly disinteresting weather.</p>
<p>How disgustingly impersonal, how socially dead.</p>
<p>Tell me what traumatized you as a child?</p>
<p>I fell during a 100m dash because of oversized sneakers,</p>
<p>That night, I screamed at my prudent parents and soaked my comforter in tears.</p>
<p>Explain to me how you met your close friend?</p>
<p>I defended a friend from her unabashed criticisms,</p>
<p>five years later she is my source of late night rants and musings.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about what is it to be human?</p>
<p>Is it our capacity to make conscious choices, even when the choices and finite?</p>
<p>Do I ooze organic-ness, or have I been conditioned to a mechanical clock?</p>
<p>Ask me about the scar on my forearm and the scars I won’t show.</p>
<p>Maybe then you’d learn my carelessness and callousness,</p>
<p>and why I still don’t listen to my parents.</p>
<p>Not the weather talk, please.</p>
<p>Tell me the worst thing you’ve done.</p>
<p>I used to be insecure about my ethnicity,</p>
<p>I watched American television and learned to hide my dialect </p>
<p>We can talk about our soft spots. You can open up.</p>
<p>Mine is my dad’s voice; I saved all his voicemails.</p>
<p>Not the weather talk, please.</p>
<p>Tell me your favourite word.</p>
<p>霖</p>
<p>it means heavy rain in the forest.</p>
<p>If we talk about weather, I will miss out on you</p>
<h2>DUO: LORD OF THE FLIES -- THE EVIL OF US</h2>
<p>Aug, 2016</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I visited to Coral Island where 2 interns were operating on a
beastie. The beastie resided in a cell bounded by steel rods, inside of which, it ate
and shitted. Its interval of nasty, brutish and short existence was interrupted by
periodical experiment: the practitioner pulled on a lever, the back-plate of the cell
thrusted forward, the beastie was wedged to the front of the cell in between bars
and backplate. The dreadful eruption from an unknown world made her frantic;
she squealed and bucked and the air was full of noise and terror. The anaesthetize
needle moved forward inch by inch and the terrified squealing became a high
pitched scream. The sow soon collapsed under us.
</p>
<p>At the end of cul-de-sac was the operation table. Beastie unconsciously laid, 
excreted, and egested. Jack attentively shaved its abdomen for sanitary reason 
while Roger marked sites of the incision with iodine. For the next few hours, slits of 
varied depth were teared and sown; and with bordering legality, I also partook in 
the feast.  </p>
<p>It would hypocritical to say that my veins were not bursting with adrenaline, or I 
didn't thirst to spill its blood in my heart of darkness. Was I exempted from the 
social constraints inside the enclosure of this coral peninsula? Have I succumb to 
Gloding's savagery that dwells within us? Have I digress to the primitive state of 
humanity?</p>
<p>"You knew, didn’t you? I’m part of you? Close, close, close!" </p>
<p>There is something problematic about the preconceived notion of 
savagery and civilization: is civilization inherently ennobling and savagery 
inherently evil. Would I be exempted from evil if I were not in the coral island? 
Isn't the coral island located within the middle of civilization? Then, there is the 
démodé perception of evil. Is the act of deliberate torture on an insentient (I know 
its arrogant to presume that of animals)  pig evil when the practice will thrive adept 
doctors? Is an agonizing pig a smaller evil than an agonizing human? It is another   
story to defend this with utilitarianism Is it shameful to feel a surge of excitement 
at the torment of beastie? What is evil and where is evil? </p>
<p>I'm reconsidering the possibility of commitment to hedonism. High by the beach 
like Dorian Grey ~</p>
<p>Admittedly, I had a lot of fun imitating the parody of a paralyzed sow. On a quasi 
unrelated note, what's your perspective on age difference in relationship; where do 
you draw the asymptote. </p>
<p>Valete!</p>
<h2>UN, AMBIVALENCE</h2>
<p>July, 2016</p>
<p>Today marks the one month of my stay in China and I am very ambivalent about this uni-prep voyage. I have completely forgone my study schedule, and I spent my days relishing my pensiveness. </p>						
<p>I visited a historical street in Beijing this weekend but the site seemed diluted and a parody of Chinese culture. I went in expecting somewhat cinematic 山水画风 stuff: drinking tea while looking through the bamboo window frames in a reverie, elders carrying the wooden cage of their chirping birds (traditionally, Chinese "walk" their birds), youth playing Chinese chess and discussing Chinese philosophy. And there it was, a Starbucks logo protruding at the entrance -- of course I went in, I needed my ice Americano to appease my anger, disappointment, and sweat! It was a three level Starbucks with all it's interior decorated in the poetic Chinese style. I was in awe by the close semblance of the table and chairs to my visionary tea room. </p>
<p>I left Starbucks feeling bemused and contempt at the trompe-l'oeil of capitalism. Every antique building was employed by capitalism to house these intruders (Zara, Starbucks, H&M, you name it). It is deceiving to call this place a historical site because other than its visage, it constitutes nothing of Chinese. The site is not only a trashy mall, but an amalgam of pretentiousness and philistine vulgarity. It felt like capitalism mocking the vulnerability of history and culture, that there is nothing it can't buy and alter.  I am appalled by the travesty of culture vulture. </p>
<p>What's something you are ambivalent about? For me, it is the hollowness of my culture and the shallowness of capitalism. I will attach some pictures of my excursion (I liked the pavement and the jagged bricks. It evokes the walking street in Montreal). </p>
<p>That's all I will relish for today. I know my current writing sounds very awkward, but give me some time to find my comfort and prose. We should find a way to have a group email conversation.</p>
